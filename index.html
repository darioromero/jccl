        <section id="main_content">
          <p>This is an old library I wrote in 2005/2006 because at the time I nearly "had to deal" with binary COBOL data files.  I ended up not having to because we found out at work it was just much much easier and more reliable to get a COBOL guy to write a little program to parse it out.  </p>

<p>For whatever reason the idea stuck so I continued working on this at home off and on for a year or so.  It was an interesting experiment at the least.  As far as I know the code works "fairly reliably" with the dozen or so datasets I tested this against.  I say "fairly reliably" because when we were digging into this at work we found that a lot of the old data sets (30+ years old) had all sorts of garbage and random shit in them (hence why the COBOL translation route was easier) and to get Java to process the data correctly you had to do a lot of weird things.</p>

<p>I'm only sticking this out here in the rare chance this might help someone.  I also don't want to pay for subversion hosting on this anymore.  This code is 100% mine except where ascribed in the header so do what you want.  I only ask you don't judge my abilities on this.  I was only a year or so out of school when I did this.  The only update this "decade" was a gradle script because maven sucks.</p>
